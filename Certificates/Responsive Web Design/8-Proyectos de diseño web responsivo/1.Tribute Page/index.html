        <section class="info-dates">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
              the "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
              Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
              Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
              scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
              US Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
              Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
              he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
              breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
              Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
              his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
              Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
              leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
              plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
              6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
              different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
              season, doubling wheat yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
              with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
              well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
              strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
              mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
              A&M University
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2005</strong> - States "we will have to double the world
              food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
              only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
              that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
              genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
              before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
            </li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
